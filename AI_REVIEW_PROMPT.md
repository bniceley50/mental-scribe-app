## Security & Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
1. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - All PHI (Protected Health Information) must be encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Audit logging required for all PHI access
   - User authentication with MFA support
   - Secure file storage with signed URLs (1-hour expiry)

2. **42 CFR Part 2 Compliance**
   - Special protection for substance abuse treatment records
   - Explicit consent required for disclosure
   - Consent tracking with expiry dates
   - Immutable consent records
   - Program-based data classification

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers from client to database
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control on all tables
- **Data Classification**: `standard_phi` vs `part2_protected`
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: `admin`, `treating_provider`, `care_team` roles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all sensitive operations
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on both client and server
- **Secure Storage**: Signed URLs only, no public access to PHI documents
- **Session Management**: sessionStorage for drafts, automatic session timeouts

## Current Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
- Email/password authentication with strength requirements
- Server-side HIBP password breach checking (fail-closed)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- MFA enrollment and verification support
- Password history prevention (last 10 passwords)
- Recovery codes with HMAC-SHA256 hashing

### Database Security Features

#### Security Definer Functions
```sql
-- Role checking (prevents RLS recursion)
has_role(user_id, role) -> boolean

-- Program membership verification
is_program_member(user_id, program_id) -> boolean

-- Clinical staff verification
is_clinical_staff(user_id, program_id) -> boolean

-- Patient assignment verification
is_assigned_to_patient(user_id, client_id) -> boolean

-- Part 2 consent verification
has_active_part2_consent_for_conversation(conversation_id) -> boolean

-- Data classification derivation
derive_classification(program_id) -> data_classification

-- External ID hashing (HMAC-SHA256)
hash_external_id(raw_id) -> text

-- Rate limiting
check_rate_limit(user_id, endpoint, max_requests, window_minutes) -> boolean
```

#### Critical Tables with RLS
- `user_roles` - RBAC implementation (admin-only write)
- `user_program_memberships` - Program assignments (admin-only write)
- `programs` - Healthcare programs (Part 2 flag)
- `clients` - Patient records (owner + assigned staff + admin)
- `patient_assignments` - Staff-to-patient assignments (admin-only write, validated)
- `conversations` - Clinical conversations (owner + staff with assignment + Part 2 consent)
- `messages` - Chat messages (tied to conversation access)
- `structured_notes` - Clinical notes (owner + staff with assignment + Part 2 consent)
- `recordings` - Audio recordings (owner + staff with assignment + Part 2 consent)
- `uploaded_files` - File attachments (tied to conversation access)
- `part2_consents` - Consent records (owner + admin, immutable)
- `disclosure_consents` - External disclosure tracking (admin + authorized users)
- `audit_logs` - Security audit trail (service role insert, admin select, immutable)
- `client_access_logs` - Patient access tracking (service role insert, admin select, immutable)
- `failed_login_attempts` - Login failure tracking (service role insert, admin select)
- `rate_limits` - Rate limiting data (RPC-only access)
- `password_history` - Password reuse prevention (service role insert)
- `mfa_recovery_codes` - MFA backup codes (hashed)

### Edge Functions Security
- **CORS Headers**: Properly configured for web app origin
- **JWT Validation**: All functions verify authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Database-backed rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas before processing
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables via Lovable Cloud secrets
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive operations logged

### Storage Security
- **Private Buckets**: `clinical-documents`, `recordings` (no public access)
- **Signed URLs**: 1-hour expiry, regenerated as needed
- **RLS Policies**: Folder-based access control (user-specific paths)
- **File Validation**: Type and size limits enforced

## Known Security Issues (Current Scan Results)

### ERROR Level (2)
1. **Patient Medical Records Could Be Stolen by Hackers**
   - **Table**: `clients`
   - **Issue**: Complex RLS policies with potential for misconfiguration
   - **Mitigation**: Recently implemented strict assignment validation + audit logging
   - **Status**: Fix implemented but needs verification

2. **Private Medical Conversations Could Be Accessed by Unauthorized Staff**
   - **Table**: `conversations`
   - **Issue**: Part 2 consent verification logic complexity
   - **Mitigation**: `has_active_part2_consent_for_conversation()` function + audit logs
   - **Status**: Needs code review of consent verification logic

### WARN Level (2)
1. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled**
   - **Status**: FALSE POSITIVE - HIBP is implemented server-side via `secure-signup` edge function
   - **Evidence**: See `supabase/functions/secure-signup/index.ts`

2. **Security Audit Logs Could Be Tampered With or Deleted**
   - **Table**: `audit_logs`
   - **Issue**: Admin DELETE policy exists
   - **Current Policy**: `audit_logs_admin_delete` allows admin deletion
   - **Recommendation**: Should be fully immutable (no DELETE allowed)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Small, focused components
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated business logic (`useConversations`, `useMessages`, etc.)
- **Design System**: Semantic tokens in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for graceful failures
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better UX

## Areas Requiring Review

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **RLS Policy Completeness**: Review all RLS policies for gaps or misconfigurations
- [ ] **RLS Policy Correctness**: Ensure policies correctly implement intended access control
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Check for any raw SQL queries (should use Supabase client methods)
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Verify all user input is sanitized (DOMPurify used where needed)
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Confirm Supabase auth tokens provide adequate protection
- [ ] **Audit Log Completeness**: Verify all PHI access is logged (especially SELECT operations)
- [ ] **Part 2 Consent Logic**: Deep review of consent verification in all data access paths
- [ ] **Patient Assignment Validation**: Verify the new `validate_patient_assignment()` trigger works correctly
- [ ] **Audit Log Immutability**: Confirm audit logs cannot be deleted or modified
- [ ] **External ID Hashing**: Ensure HMAC secret is properly configured and secure
- [ ] **Session Management**: Check for session fixation or hijacking vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limits are effective and cannot be bypassed
- [ ] **File Upload Security**: Check for file type validation and size limits
- [ ] **API Key Exposure**: Scan for hardcoded secrets or leaked credentials

### 2. Code Quality & Best Practices
- [ ] **TypeScript Usage**: Are types properly defined? Any `any` types that should be stricter?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are errors caught and handled gracefully?
- [ ] **Code Duplication**: Any significant code that could be refactored?
- [ ] **Component Size**: Are components appropriately sized (not too large)?
- [ ] **Function Complexity**: Any functions that are too complex or nested?
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Are variables/functions named clearly?
- [ ] **Comments**: Is complex logic adequately documented?
- [ ] **React Best Practices**: Proper hook usage, key props, dependency arrays?
- [ ] **Performance**: Any unnecessary re-renders or expensive operations?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML?

### 3. Database Design
- [ ] **Schema Normalization**: Is the database properly normalized?
- [ ] **Indexes**: Are appropriate indexes in place for query performance?
- [ ] **Foreign Keys**: Are relationships properly defined with cascading rules?
- [ ] **Constraints**: Are NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints appropriate?
- [ ] **Data Types**: Are column types optimal for the data stored?
- [ ] **Triggers**: Are triggers necessary and correct? Any performance concerns?
- [ ] **Functions**: Are security definer functions safe from SQL injection?
- [ ] **Migration History**: Are migrations clean and reversible?

### 4. Maintainability
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Is the codebase logically structured?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Are dependencies up-to-date and minimal?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is the code and architecture well-documented?
- [ ] **Testing**: What test coverage exists? (Currently minimal - see `src/components/__tests__/`)
- [ ] **Build Configuration**: Is Vite config optimal?
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Are all secrets properly externalized?
- [ ] **Edge Function Structure**: Are edge functions modular and testable?
- [ ] **Deployment Readiness**: Any production concerns?

### 5. Specific Security Concerns to Investigate

#### Critical: Audit Logging Gap
**Issue**: The `log_client_view()` RPC function exists but is NOT called in application code.
**Impact**: HIPAA compliance gap - client data SELECT operations are not being audited.
**Files to Check**:
- `src/pages/ClientProfile.tsx` - Should call `log_client_view()` on mount
- `src/components/clients/ClientsList.tsx` - Should call on client card click
- Consider creating `src/lib/clientAudit.ts` utility for centralized audit logic

#### Critical: RLS Policy for Patient Assignments
**Recently Changed**: `docs/migrations/2025-10-06_tighten-clients-rls.sql`
**New Policy**: Clinical staff can only SELECT clients they are assigned to
**Function**: `is_assigned_to_patient(auth.uid(), client_id)`
**Review**:
- Verify function logic is correct
- Test with different user roles (admin, staff, owner)
- Confirm it prevents cross-program access
- Check performance with large datasets

#### High Priority: Part 2 Consent Verification
**Function**: `has_active_part2_consent_for_conversation(conversation_id)`
**Used In**: RLS policies for `conversations`, `structured_notes`, `recordings`
**Review Points**:
- Verify consent status checks (`status = 'active'`)
- Confirm expiry date validation (`expiry_date IS NULL OR expiry_date > now()`)
- Check revocation handling (`revoked_date IS NULL`)
- Ensure granted date is checked (`granted_date <= now()`)
- Test edge cases (expired consents, revoked consents, future-dated consents)

#### Medium Priority: Admin DELETE on Audit Logs
**Current State**: `audit_logs_admin_delete` policy allows admin deletion
**HIPAA Requirement**: Audit logs must be immutable and tamper-proof
**Action Needed**: Remove DELETE policy and document retention strategy

### 6. Documentation Review
- [ ] Is `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` accurate and up-to-date?
- [ ] Is `docs/AUTH_FLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md` complete?
- [ ] Are security docs (`SECURITY*.md`) comprehensive?
- [ ] Is the API documented (if applicable)?
- [ ] Are there clear contribution guidelines?
- [ ] Is deployment process documented?

- Components must use design system tokens, not direct colors
- Dark mode support via CSS custom properties

### Known Limitations
- Test coverage is minimal (few tests in `src/components/__tests__/`)
- Some edge functions may need refactoring for better modularity
- Complex RLS policies may have performance implications at scale
- Audit log viewing UI for admins not yet implemented

### Recent Security Fixes
- Fixed patient assignment validation (admin-only creation)
- Added `client_access_logs` table for comprehensive auditing
- Implemented `validate_patient_assignment()` trigger
- Created `get_suspicious_access_patterns()` for anomaly detection
- Tightened RLS on `clients` table to require assignment verification
