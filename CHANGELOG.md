## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

No breaking changes. This is a backward-compatible release.

**What's New:**
- Enhanced security features work automatically
- Error boundaries provide better error recovery
- No action required from users or developers

**For Developers:**
If you've added custom templates or prompts, consider migrating them to:
- `/src/constants/noteTemplates.ts` for note templates
- `/src/constants/examplePrompts.ts` for example prompts

**Testing:**
Run the new test suite to ensure your customizations still work:
```bash
npm test
```
