## üöÄ Ship Workflow (Complete)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Check (30-60s)

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git switch chore/ci-hardening && git rev-parse --short HEAD
npm ci
npm run build
npm run sec:prove   # should exit 0
```

**Expected**: All commands succeed, `sec:prove` exits with code `0`

### Step 2: Merge to Main

**Option A: GitHub UI** (Recommended)
1. Open https://github.com/bniceley50/mental-scribe-app/pull/8
2. Click "Merge pull request" (use "Create a merge commit")
3. Confirm merge

**Option B: Automated Script**
```powershell
.\scripts\merge-and-release.ps1
```

**Option C: Manual CLI**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --no-ff chore/ci-hardening -m "merge: security hardening (3/3)"
npm version patch -m "release: security hardening (3/3)"
git push origin main --tags
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release with Proof Artifacts

```powershell
.\scripts\create-release-with-proof.ps1
```

This will:
- Create GitHub Release with generated release notes
- Attach all proof artifacts automatically:
  - `proof/PROOF.md`
  - `security/summary.json`
  - `security/artifacts/playwright.json`
  - `security/artifacts/csp-evaluator.txt`
  - `review/REVIEW.md`
  - `review/findings.json`
- Generate release URL

**Or manually**:
1. Go to https://github.com/bniceley50/mental-scribe-app/releases/new
2. Select the new tag (e.g., `v0.0.1`)
3. Title: "Security Hardening Release (3/3 Proof)"
4. Attach artifacts listed above
5. Publish release

### Step 4: Post-Merge Hardening

**Immediate** (same day):
- [ ] Enable branch protection on `main`:
  - Require `security-proof` workflow to pass
  - Require status checks: `build`, `tsc`, `eslint`
- [ ] Verify CI passes on `main`
- [ ] Delete `chore/ci-hardening` branch
- [ ] Add security badge to README

**Recommended** (within 1 week):
- [ ] Add nightly proof cron job
- [ ] Set up CI alerts (Slack/Discord)
- [ ] Archive CI artifacts for compliance
- [ ] Document security process in onboarding
