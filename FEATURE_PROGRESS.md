**Test Results**:

```text
✓ test/types.test.ts (5 tests) 3ms
  ✓ Event Types > isMScribeEvent > should return true for valid events
  ✓ Event Types > isMScribeEvent > should return false for invalid events
  ✓ Event Types > createEvent > should create RunStartedEvent with timestamp
  ✓ Event Types > createEvent > should create TextMessageDelta with timestamp
  ✓ Event Types > createEvent > should create ErrorEvent with context
```

### ✅ Feature #3: Flow Engine & Playground

  - 9 passing tests covering step creation, execution, conditions, error handling
- ✅ Documentation (`packages/flows/README.md`)
  - Complete usage guide with examples
  - React integration patterns
  - Best practices for flow design

**Test Results**:

```text
✓ test/engine.test.ts (9 tests) 7ms
  ✓ Flow Engine > createStep > should create a step with required fields
  ✓ Flow Engine > createStep > should create a step with optional fields
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should execute a simple flow with one step
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should execute multiple steps sequentially
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should skip steps when condition returns false
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should handle step errors with step-level error handler
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should handle flow-level errors
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should pass context between steps
  ✓ Flow Engine > startFlow > should include execution metadata
```

## In Progress

None - ready for Feature #4!

## Remaining Features (Not Started)

### Feature #4: CLI Tool
