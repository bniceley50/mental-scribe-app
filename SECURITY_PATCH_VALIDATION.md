# Security Compliance Patch - Validation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the three security vulnerabilities addressed in this patch and how to validate they have been properly fixed.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. PHI Redaction Before External LLM/Vendor Calls ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/functions/utils/redactPHI.ts` (NEW) - Core PHI redaction utility for Deno edge functions
- `src/lib/phi/redactPHI.ts` (NEW) - Shared TypeScript version for testing
- `supabase/functions/analyze-field/index.ts` - Now redacts PHI before sending to LLM
- `supabase/functions/analyze-clinical-notes/index.ts` - Now redacts PHI before sending to LLM
- `src/lib/__tests__/redactPHI.test.ts` (NEW) - Comprehensive test suite

**PHI Types Redacted:**
- Social Security Numbers (SSN): `123-45-6789` → `[SSN-REDACTED]`
- Phone Numbers: `(555) 123-4567` → `[PHONE-REDACTED]`
- Email Addresses: `patient@example.com` → `[EMAIL-REDACTED]`
- Dates of Birth: `01/15/1990` → `[DATE-REDACTED]`
- Medical Record Numbers: `MRN: ABC123456` → `[MRN-REDACTED]`

**Validation Steps:**
1. Test with sample data containing PHI in the analyze-field function
2. Verify that prompts sent to LLM have PHI masked
3. Run the test suite: `npm test src/lib/__tests__/redactPHI.test.ts`
4. Check edge function logs to confirm no PHI is logged

### 2. Signed URL TTL Reduced to 60 Seconds ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/signedUrls.ts` - Changed `SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY` from 3600 to 60
- `src/lib/__tests__/signedUrls.test.ts` - Updated test expectations

**Change Details:**
- Previous TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- New TTL: 60 seconds (for maximum PHI security)
- All PHI documents (clinical-documents bucket) now use 60-second expiry
- Custom shorter TTLs can still be specified for enhanced security

**Validation Steps:**
1. Generate a signed URL for a clinical document
2. Verify it expires after 60 seconds
3. Check that the URL contains `exp=60` or similar parameter
4. Run existing tests: `npm test src/lib/__tests__/signedUrls.test.ts`

### 3. .env Removed from Version Control ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `.env` - Removed from git tracking (deleted from repository)
- `.gitignore` - Added explicit `.env` ignore rules
- `.env.example` (NEW) - Template for environment variables
- `SECURITY.md` - Updated with key rotation documentation

**Change Details:**
- `.env` file no longer tracked in git
- Added comprehensive `.env` ignore patterns to `.gitignore`
- Created `.env.example` as a template
- Documented key rotation requirements

**Key Rotation Required:**
If `.env` was previously committed to version control, the following keys may have been exposed and should be rotated:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Regenerate in Supabase dashboard
- Any other secrets that were in the .env file

**Validation Steps:**
1. Verify `.env` is not in git: `git ls-files | grep "^\.env$"` (should return nothing)
2. Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`: `cat .gitignore | grep ".env"`
3. Check that `.env.example` exists with template values
4. Rotate exposed keys if they were previously committed

## Build & Test Status

- ✅ Build: Successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ TypeScript Compilation: No errors
- ⚠️ Tests: Not run yet (no test script in package.json, but vitest is configured)

## Security Impact

### Before Patch:
- PHI could be sent to external LLM services without redaction
- Signed URLs valid for 1 hour, increasing exposure window
- .env file tracked in git, potentially exposing secrets

### After Patch:
- PHI automatically redacted before external API calls
- Signed URLs expire after 60 seconds, minimizing exposure
- .env no longer tracked, secrets protected

## Compliance Notes

This patch addresses:
- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI protection during data transmission
- **42 CFR Part 2**: Enhanced protection for substance abuse records
- **Security Best Practices**: Secrets management and time-limited access

## Next Steps

1. Deploy edge functions with new PHI redaction
2. Rotate any exposed keys from previous .env commits
3. Verify signed URLs in production have 60s TTL
4. Monitor logs to ensure no PHI leakage
5. Update compliance documentation

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run linter (requires dependencies)
npm run lint

# Run tests (with vitest)
npx vitest run

# Check specific test file
npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/redactPHI.test.ts
npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/signedUrls.test.ts
```

## Additional Notes

- The PHI redaction utility uses regex patterns for common PHI identifiers
- Patterns may need adjustment based on specific organizational needs
- The 60-second TTL applies to default usage; custom TTLs can still be specified
- Client applications may need to handle more frequent URL refreshes
