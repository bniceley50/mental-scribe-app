## 🔗 Pull Request
**PR #8**: https://github.com/bniceley50/mental-scribe-app/pull/8
- Updated with polished description
- All artifacts committed
- Ready for review and merge

## 📋 To Merge & Release

### Option 1: GitHub UI (Recommended)
1. Go to PR #8: https://github.com/bniceley50/mental-scribe-app/pull/8
2. Click "Squash and merge" or "Merge pull request"
3. Confirm merge
4. Optionally tag release from main branch

### Option 2: Command Line (Automated)
```powershell
# Run the merge script
.\scripts\merge-and-release.ps1
```

This will:
1. Checkout and update main
2. Merge chore/ci-hardening with --no-ff
3. Create patch version tag
4. Push everything to remote

### Option 3: Manual Commands
```powershell
git checkout main
git pull
git merge --no-ff chore/ci-hardening -m "merge: security hardening (3/3) + review artifacts"
npm version patch -m "release: security hardening + verifiable proof (3/3)"
git push && git push --tags
```

## 🛡️ Branch Protection (Recommended Next Step)

After merge, configure branch protection for `main`:

1. Go to: Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass:
     - build
     - typecheck  
     - lint
     - Playwright E2E
     - security-proof
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution
   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
