# PR: Comprehensive Security Review and Pagination Integration

## Summary

- Adds comprehensive security review document (2025-10-21)
- Introduces keyset pagination for messages with accessible UI
- Maintains existing security posture; validates with build and CSP smoke test

## Changes

- docs/SECURITY_REVIEW_2025-10-21.md — Executive summary, verified controls, findings, scorecard, readiness checklist
- src/lib/pagination.ts — Shared helpers for dedupe/sort
- src/features/messages/api/fetchMessages.ts — Keyset pagination API
- src/features/messages/components/Thread.tsx — UI with "Load older"
- src/pages/History.tsx — Integrate Thread into History view
- deliverables/QUICK_SHIP_CARD_2025-10-21.md — One-page exec summary

## Security Impact

- RLS remains enforced; pagination uses created_at cursor and respects policies
- No relaxation of CSP; preview smoke test passes
- No new external services or secrets

## Risks

- Minimal UI regression in History view; confined to messages list
- Mitigation: Feature is incremental; sorted, deduped render; easy rollback by reverting to previous rendering

## Testing

- Build: vite build (PASS)
- Preview CSP smoke: playwright (PASS)
- Pagination e2e: scaffolded; enable with storage state and seeded data (optional)

## Checklist

- [x] Build passes locally
- [x] CSP smoke passes locally
- [x] Docs added/updated
- [x] No secrets committed
- [x] Changes respect RLS and CSP policies
