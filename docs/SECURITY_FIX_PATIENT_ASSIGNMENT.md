# Critical Security Fix: Patient Assignment Validation

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Patient Medical Records Exposed to Unauthorized Staff

## Executive Summary

Fixed a critical security vulnerability where staff members could potentially create their own patient assignments, granting themselves unauthorized access to sensitive patient medical records.

## Vulnerability Details

### Original Issue
The `patient_assignments` table had overly permissive policies that allowed:
1. Staff to view their own assignments without verification
2. No enforcement that only administrators could create assignments
3. No validation that assigned staff had appropriate credentials
4. No validation that staff were in the same program as the patient
5. Insufficient audit logging for patient data access

### Attack Scenario
A malicious staff member could:
1. Insert a row into `patient_assignments` with their own `staff_user_id` and any `client_id`
2. Gain immediate access to that client's sensitive PHI data
3. Access records across programs they weren't authorized for
4. Access patient data without proper clinical credentials

### Impact
- **HIPAA Violation**: Unauthorized access to Protected Health Information
- **Part 2 Violation**: Potential access to substance abuse treatment records
- **Data Breach**: Sensitive patient data (DOB, diagnoses, treatment goals, insurance info)

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Restricted Assignment Creation (CRITICAL)

**Before**: No policies prevented staff from creating their own assignments

**After**: Added restrictive policies
```sql
CREATE POLICY "patient_assignments_admin_insert"
ON public.patient_assignments
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role)
  AND assigned_by = auth.uid()
);
```

**Impact**: Only users with 'admin' role can create patient assignments

---

### 2. Assignment Validation Trigger (CRITICAL)

Added comprehensive validation before assignment creation:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.validate_patient_assignment()
-- Validates:
-- 1. Only admins can create assignments
-- 2. Staff member is in same program as client
-- 3. Staff has appropriate clinical role (treating_provider or care_team)
-- 4. Auto-sets assigned_by and assigned_at fields
```

**Validations Enforced**:
- ‚úÖ Creator must be admin
- ‚úÖ Staff must be member of client's program
- ‚úÖ Staff must have clinical role ('treating_provider' or 'care_team')
- ‚úÖ Automatic assignment attribution (`assigned_by`, `assigned_at`)

**Error Messages**:
- "Only administrators can create patient assignments"
- "Cannot assign staff member to client: staff is not in the same program with appropriate clinical role"

---

### 3. Read-Only Staff Access (HIGH)

**Before**: `patient_assignments_staff_view_own` allowed SELECT

**After**: Replaced with stricter policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "patient_assignments_staff_select_own"
ON public.patient_assignments
FOR SELECT
USING (
  auth.uid() = staff_user_id 
  AND revoked_at IS NULL
);
```

**Impact**: Staff can only view their active assignments (read-only, no modifications)

---

### 4. Comprehensive Access Logging (HIGH)

Created new `client_access_logs` table to track all client data access:

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.client_access_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id UUID NOT NULL,
  accessed_by UUID NOT NULL,
  access_type TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'view'
  access_method TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'direct_owner', 'clinical_staff', 'admin'
  program_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Triggers**:
- INSERT on `clients` ‚Üí logs 'create' access
- UPDATE on `clients` ‚Üí logs 'update' access  
- DELETE on `clients` ‚Üí logs 'delete' access

**Application-Level Logging**:
- Created `log_client_view()` function for SELECT operations
- Application must call this when viewing client records

---

### 5. Suspicious Activity Detection (MEDIUM)

Created admin function to detect suspicious access patterns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_suspicious_access_patterns(
  _hours_lookback := 24,      -- Last 24 hours
  _access_threshold := 10      -- 10+ accesses
);
```

**Returns**:
- User ID accessing records
- Total access count
- Number of unique clients accessed
- Access types (create, update, delete, view)
- Access methods (owner, clinical_staff, admin)

**Use Case**: Detect bulk data exfiltration, unauthorized snooping

## Database Changes Summary

### New Tables
1. **`client_access_logs`**
   - Purpose: Immutable audit log for all client data access
   - Retention: Indefinite (for HIPAA compliance)
   - Access: Admin-only SELECT, system INSERT

### Modified Tables
1. **`patient_assignments`**
   - Added trigger: `validate_patient_assignment_trigger` (BEFORE INSERT)
   - Replaced policy: `patient_assignments_staff_view_own` ‚Üí `patient_assignments_staff_select_own`
   - Added policies: `patient_assignments_admin_insert`, `patient_assignments_admin_update`, `patient_assignments_admin_delete`

### New Functions
1. **`validate_patient_assignment()`** - Validates assignment creation
2. **`log_client_modification()`** - Logs INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on clients
3. **`log_client_view(_client_id, _access_method)`** - Logs SELECT (application-level)
4. **`get_suspicious_access_patterns(_hours, _threshold)`** - Detects anomalies

### New Triggers
1. `log_client_insert_trigger` - After INSERT on clients
2. `log_client_update_trigger` - After UPDATE on clients
3. `log_client_delete_trigger` - After DELETE on clients
4. `validate_patient_assignment_trigger` - Before INSERT on patient_assignments

### New Indexes
1. `idx_client_access_logs_client_accessed` - Fast client access history
2. `idx_client_access_logs_accessor` - Fast user access history
3. `idx_client_access_logs_type` - Fast access type filtering

## Application Integration Required

### 1. Client Viewing (HIGH PRIORITY)

When fetching client records, log the access:

```typescript
// In ClientProfile.tsx or wherever client data is fetched
const { data: client, error } = await supabase
  .from('clients')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', clientId)
  .single();

if (client) {
  // Log the view access
  await supabase.rpc('log_client_view', {
    _client_id: clientId,
    _access_method: 'clinical_staff' // or 'direct_owner', 'admin'
  });
}
```

### 2. Admin Assignment UI

Create admin interface for patient assignment management:

```typescript
// Only admins can create assignments
const createAssignment = async (staffUserId: string, clientId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('patient_assignments')
    .insert({
      staff_user_id: staffUserId,
      client_id: clientId,
      // assigned_by and assigned_at auto-set by trigger
    });

  if (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('Only administrators')) {
      toast.error('Access denied: Admin privileges required');
    } else if (error.message.includes('not in the same program')) {
      toast.error('Cannot assign: Staff not authorized for this program');
    } else {
      toast.error('Assignment failed: ' + error.message);
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Access Log Review Dashboard

Create admin dashboard to review access patterns:

```typescript
// Admin dashboard component
const SuspiciousActivityDashboard = () => {
  const [patterns, setPatterns] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPatterns = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_suspicious_access_patterns', {
        _hours_lookback: 24,
        _access_threshold: 10
      });
      setPatterns(data);
    };
    fetchPatterns();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Suspicious Access Patterns (Last 24 Hours)</h2>
      {patterns.map(pattern => (
        <div key={pattern.accessed_by}>
          <p>User: {pattern.accessed_by}</p>
          <p>Accesses: {pattern.access_count}</p>
          <p>Unique Clients: {pattern.unique_clients}</p>
          <p>Methods: {pattern.access_methods.join(', ')}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Verify only admins can create patient assignments
- [ ] Verify staff cannot self-assign to patients
- [ ] Verify cross-program assignment attempts are blocked
- [ ] Verify assignment requires appropriate clinical role
- [ ] Verify access logs are created on client modifications
- [ ] Verify `log_client_view()` function works correctly
- [ ] Test suspicious activity detection with sample data

### After Deployment
- [ ] Monitor `client_access_logs` table for activity
- [ ] Review access patterns for anomalies
- [ ] Verify no unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Confirm audit logs are immutable
- [ ] Test assignment revocation workflow

## HIPAA Compliance Impact

### Before Fix
‚ùå **Risk**: Unrestricted staff access to patient records  
‚ùå **Audit**: Insufficient logging of data access  
‚ùå **Control**: No validation of assignment legitimacy  

### After Fix
‚úÖ **Access Control**: Admin-only assignment creation  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive access logging  
‚úÖ **Validation**: Multi-layered assignment verification  
‚úÖ **Detection**: Suspicious activity monitoring  

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback via:

```sql
-- 1. Drop new triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS validate_patient_assignment_trigger ON public.patient_assignments;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_client_insert_trigger ON public.clients;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_client_update_trigger ON public.clients;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS log_client_delete_trigger ON public.clients;

-- 2. Drop new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "patient_assignments_admin_insert" ON public.patient_assignments;
-- ... (drop other new policies)

-- 3. Restore original policy
CREATE POLICY "patient_assignments_staff_view_own"
ON public.patient_assignments
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = staff_user_id);

-- 4. Optionally drop client_access_logs table
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.client_access_logs CASCADE;
```

**Note**: Keep `client_access_logs` table for forensic analysis even if rolling back.
