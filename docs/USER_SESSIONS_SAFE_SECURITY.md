# user_sessions_safe View Security Documentation

## Security Scanner False Positive

The security scanner flags `user_sessions_safe` as "publicly readable with no RLS policies." This is a **FALSE POSITIVE** for the following reasons:

## Why The View Is Already Secure

### 1. Built-in WHERE Clause Filtering
```sql
CREATE VIEW public.user_sessions_safe
WITH (security_barrier = true, security_invoker = true)
AS
SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  ip_address,
  user_agent,
  created_at,
  last_activity_at,
  expires_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN expires_at > now() THEN 'active'::text
    ELSE 'expired'::text
  END AS status
FROM public.user_sessions
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role);
```

**Key Security Features:**
- `WHERE user_id = auth.uid()`: Only returns sessions for the current authenticated user
- `OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role)`: Admins can see all sessions
- **Anonymous users get ZERO rows** because `auth.uid()` returns NULL when not authenticated

### 2. security_barrier = true
Prevents PostgreSQL query optimizer from pulling predicates out of the view, which could bypass security filters.

### 3. security_invoker = true  
The view executes with the permissions of the user calling it, not the view owner. This means:
- Anonymous users have no auth.uid(), so WHERE clause returns nothing
- Authenticated users only see their own sessions
- Admins see all sessions only if they have the admin role

### 4. Underlying Table Protection
The `user_sessions` table has:
- **FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY** enabled
- RESTRICTIVE policy blocking all anonymous access
- Authenticated users can only see their own sessions

## Why RLS Cannot Be Added to Views

PostgreSQL does not support `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on views (only on tables). Attempting to do so results in:
```
ERROR: ALTER action ENABLE ROW SECURITY cannot be performed on relation "user_sessions_safe"
DETAIL: This operation is not supported for views.
```

## Defense-in-Depth Layers

1. **View WHERE Clause**: Filters at query time
2. **security_barrier**: Prevents optimizer bypass
3. **security_invoker**: Uses caller's permissions
4. **Underlying Table RLS**: Additional protection on user_sessions
5. **FORCE RLS**: Cannot be bypassed by service role

## Verification

To verify anonymous users cannot access the view:

```sql
-- As anonymous user (should return 0 rows)
SET ROLE anon;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.user_sessions_safe;
-- Expected: 0

-- As authenticated user (should only see own sessions)
-- (Test via application with auth.uid() set)

-- As admin (should see all sessions)
-- (Test via application with admin role)
```

## Security Posture: âœ… SECURE

The view is secure through PostgreSQL's built-in view security mechanisms and does not require explicit RLS policies. The security scanner's warning can be safely ignored or marked as a false positive.
