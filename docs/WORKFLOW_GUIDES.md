   Choose from these quick action buttons:
   - **SOAP Note**: Generates structured Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan format
   - **Summary**: Creates comprehensive session summary with key moments
   - **Key Points**: Extracts clinically significant points in bullet format
   - **Progress Report**: Documents therapeutic gains and continued focus areas

### Tips for Best Results
