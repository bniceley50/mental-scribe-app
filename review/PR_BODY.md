# Security Hardening: 3/3 Controls Passing + Comprehensive Review

## ‚úÖ Executive Summary

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Security Proof | **PASS (3/3)** | `csp_strict`, `no_secrets_in_dist`, `e2e_smoke` |
| TypeScript | **Clean** | 0 errors |
| ESLint | **Clean** | 0 issues (A grade) |
| Build | **Success** | exit 0 |
| Bundle Size | **Optimized** | ~0.08 MB total |
| Source Maps | **None in production** | ‚úì OK |
| E2E Tests | **Passing** | Playwright smoke ‚úì OK |

**Verdict: SHIP** ‚Äî all security controls pass with verifiable evidence, clean code quality metrics, and optimized bundle.

## üîé What Changed (Highlights)

- ‚úÖ Implemented security proof pipeline with **3/3 passing gates**
- ‚úÖ Ensured **no JWT-like tokens or secrets** in production bundle
- ‚úÖ Enforced **strict CSP**; verified via evaluator output
- ‚úÖ Wired **CI-ready scripts** for repeatable local/CI proof runs
- ‚úÖ Optimized build output; confirmed **no `.map` files** shipped
- ‚úÖ Fixed exit code handling: `sec:prove` returns **exit 0** on full pass

## üìÅ Evidence & Artifacts

All proof artifacts committed to `chore/ci-hardening`:

- [`security/summary.json`](security/summary.json) ‚Äî proof score & results
- [`security/artifacts/playwright.json`](security/artifacts/playwright.json) ‚Äî E2E output (JSON)
- [`security/artifacts/csp-evaluator.txt`](security/artifacts/csp-evaluator.txt) ‚Äî CSP analysis tail
- [`proof/PROOF.md`](proof/PROOF.md) ‚Äî environment, commit, logs, manifest
- [`review/artifacts/`](review/artifacts/) ‚Äî build logs, bundle analysis, static checks
- [`review/REVIEWER_BLURB.md`](review/REVIEWER_BLURB.md) ‚Äî Complete reviewer checklist

## ÔøΩ How to Re-Verify Locally

```bash
# fresh deps
npm ci

# run the proof end-to-end
npm run sec:clean
npm run sec:prove

# sanity: build and inspect bundle
npm run build
node -e "const fs=require('fs');console.log('dist exists:',fs.existsSync('dist'))"
```

Expected: `sec:prove` exits with code **0** on 3/3 pass.

## üîê Security Controls (detail)

1. **CSP Strict**: No high-severity issues reported in evaluator tail
2. **No Secrets in Dist**: 0 JWT-like tokens detected in `dist/*` (legit URLs/asset hashes ignored)
3. **E2E Smoke**: Playwright smoke tests pass; JSON output attached

## ‚úÖ Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Review `security/summary.json` (score & pass list)
- [ ] Glance `proof/PROOF.md` (context + manifest)
- [ ] Confirm `csp-evaluator.txt` tail shows no high-severity items
- [ ] Verify no `*.map` files in `dist/`
- [ ] (Optional) Run verification commands above locally

## ÔøΩ Merge & Release

```bash
# Merge in GitHub UI (recommended) OR use automated script:
.\scripts\merge-and-release.ps1

# Manual merge:
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --no-ff chore/ci-hardening -m "merge: security hardening (3/3)"
npm version patch -m "release: security hardening + proof (3/3)"
git push && git push --tags
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Post-Merge Guardrails (recommended)

1. **Branch protection**: require the `security-proof` workflow on PRs
2. **Archive CI artifacts** for compliance (retain proof logs/manifests)
3. **Schedule a weekly proof run** (cron) to catch drifts/regressions
4. **Add a SECURITY.md badge/link** to the README (optional)
