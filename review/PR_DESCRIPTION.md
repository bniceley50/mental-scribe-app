# Security Hardening: 3/3 Controls Passing + Comprehensive Review

**Status**
- ✅ CSP Strict
- ✅ No Secrets in Dist
- ✅ E2E Smoke (Playwright)
- 🧪 TS=0, ESLint=0, build success, no prod source maps
- 📦 Bundle: ~0.08 MB (optimized)

**Artifacts**
- Review (exec summary + findings): `review/REVIEW.md`, `review/findings.json`
- Security proof: `security/summary.json`, `proof/PROOF.md`
- Raw outputs (build, lint, etc.): `review/artifacts/*` (see PR artifacts)

**What changed**
- Wired proof scripts + CI workflow (`.github/workflows/security-proof.yml`)
- Moved test-only assets out of prod bundle (eliminated JWT tokens)
- Locked down build (no source maps in production)
- Added developer onboarding (`.env.example`), proof fallback logic
- Comprehensive review pipeline with automated artifact generation

**How to verify locally**
```bash
npm ci
npm run sec:prove
npm run build
npx playwright test --reporter=line
```

**Verdict**: ✅ **SHIP**

## 📊 Security Proof Evidence
All three security controls passing with comprehensive automated validation:

1. **CSP Strict**: No high-severity Content Security Policy issues
2. **No Secrets in Dist**: 0 JWT-like tokens found in production bundle (reduced from 2)
3. **E2E Smoke**: All Playwright end-to-end tests passing

## 🎯 Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Clean compilation (0 errors)
- **ESLint**: 0 issues detected
- **Build**: Successful (exit code 0)
- **Bundle Size**: 0.08 MB (optimized, tree-shaken)
- **Source Maps**: None in production (security hardened)

## 📁 Review Artifacts
Complete audit trail available:
- `review/REVIEW.md` - Executive summary with SHIP verdict
- `review/findings.json` - Machine-readable findings (0 critical blockers)
- `security/summary.json` - Final 3/3 security score
- `proof/PROOF.md` - Complete proof with environment details and timestamps
- `review/artifacts/` - All raw analysis outputs

## 🚀 CI/CD Enhancements
- Automated security proof workflow on every PR
- Artifact publishing for audit trail
- Fallback logic to prevent missing proof states

**Ready to merge and ship!** 🚢
