## 📊 What Was Fixed

### Critical Issues
- ✅ **Production blank screen** - Removed inline `onload` + fixed treeshake
- ✅ **CSP configuration** - Moved to response headers via `vercel.json`
- ✅ **React bootstrap** - Preserved side effects to prevent bundle optimization from dropping React entry

### Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Auth UX** - Added autocomplete, autoCapitalize, spellCheck attributes
- ✅ **Ref warnings** - Converted Badge and NoteTemplates to forwardRef
- ✅ **Test coverage** - Added CSP smoke test with Playwright
- ✅ **CI pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails Implemented

### Automated Testing
- **CSP Smoke Test** (`test/e2e/csp-smoke.spec.ts`)
  - Verifies page renders (no blank screen)
  - Checks for CSP violations in console
  - Runs in ~5 seconds

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview-smoke.yml`)
  - Runs on every PR
  - Blocks merge if smoke test fails
  - Uploads test results on failure

### Production Security
- **Vercel Headers** (`vercel.json`)
  - Content-Security-Policy with strict directives
  - HSTS with preload
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - COOP/CORP for isolation
  - Permissions-Policy restrictions

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

If production issues occur after deployment:

### Option 1: Git Revert (Fastest)
```bash
git checkout main
git revert --no-edit HEAD
git push
# Vercel auto-deploys reverted code
```

### Option 2: Vercel UI Rollback
1. Open Vercel dashboard
2. Deployments → Previous deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Option 3: Tag Rollback
```bash
git checkout v1.1.0  # previous working tag
git tag v1.2.1 -m "rollback to v1.1.0"
git push origin v1.2.1
# Deploy v1.2.1 from Vercel
```

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm ci
npm run build
```

### Preview Shows Blank Screen
```bash
# Check console for errors
npm run preview
# Open http://localhost:4173
# F12 → Console → look for CSP violations
```

### Smoke Test Fails
```bash
# Run with debug output
DEBUG=pw:api npm run test:smoke:preview

# Check test results
ls -la test-results/
```

### Production Headers Missing
1. Check `vercel.json` is committed
2. Verify Vercel deployment includes file
3. Check Vercel dashboard → Settings → Headers
4. Trigger manual redeploy if needed
