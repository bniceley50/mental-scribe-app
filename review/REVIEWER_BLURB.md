## Security Hardening Review - Ready to Ship âœ…

### Security Proof Status: **3/3 Passing** ðŸŽ¯

All security controls validated and verified:

- âœ… **CSP Strict**: Content Security Policy enforced, no high-severity issues
- âœ… **No Secrets in Dist**: Zero JWT/API keys leaked in production bundle  
- âœ… **E2E Smoke Tests**: Application loads and renders correctly

**Exit code**: `0` (clean pass, all thresholds met)

### Code Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript**: 0 errors
- **ESLint**: 0 issues  
- **Build**: Successful (exit 0)
- **Bundle Size**: 82.11 KB (optimized, no source maps)

### CI/CD Enhancements

- Added automated security proof workflow (`.github/workflows/security-proof.yml`)
- Proof runs on every PR to validate security controls
- Exit code now properly reflects pass/fail status

### Artifacts & Evidence

All proof artifacts committed to `review/artifacts/`:
- `build.log` - Full build output
- `sec-prove-final.log` - Security proof execution
- `playwright-test.log` - E2E test results
- `dist-size.json` - Bundle analysis

**Security summary**: `security/summary.json` (3/3 score)  
**Comprehensive audit trail**: `proof/PROOF.md`

### Verification Commands

To re-run the proof locally:

```bash
npm run sec:clean
npm run build
npx playwright test
node scripts/security-score.mjs
```

Expected output: `{"score": 3, "max": 3, ...}` with exit code `0`

### Ship Decision: **APPROVED** âœ…

All checks passing, no critical blockers, ready for merge to `main`.
