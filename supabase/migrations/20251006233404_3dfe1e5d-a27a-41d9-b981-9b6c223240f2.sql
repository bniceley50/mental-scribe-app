-- ============================================================================
-- CRITICAL: Fix publicly readable audit tables and user_sessions_safe view
-- ============================================================================
-- Scanner detections:
-- 1. audit_logs - publicly readable (missing restrictive SELECT for non-admins)
-- 2. client_access_logs - publicly readable (missing restrictive SELECT)
-- 3. user_sessions_safe - no RLS (views can't have RLS, must use security_barrier)
-- ============================================================================

-- ============== FIX 1: audit_logs SELECT policies ==============
-- Drop permissive admin-only SELECT and replace with restrictive approach
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "audit_logs_admin_select" ON public.audit_logs;

-- Block all authenticated non-admin users from SELECT
CREATE POLICY "audit_logs_block_non_admin_select"
ON public.audit_logs
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));

-- Ensure anon can't SELECT either (belt and suspenders)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "audit_logs_block_anon" ON public.audit_logs;
CREATE POLICY "audit_logs_block_anon_select"
ON public.audit_logs
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (false);

-- ============== FIX 2: client_access_logs SELECT policies ==============
-- Drop existing and create restrictive SELECT
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "client_access_logs_admin_select" ON public.client_access_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "client_access_logs_block_anon" ON public.client_access_logs;

-- Only admins can SELECT
CREATE POLICY "client_access_logs_admin_only_select"
ON public.client_access_logs
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));

-- Block anon completely
CREATE POLICY "client_access_logs_block_anon_all"
ON public.client_access_logs
FOR ALL
TO anon
USING (false)
WITH CHECK (false);

-- Block non-admin authenticated from SELECT
CREATE POLICY "client_access_logs_block_non_admin"
ON public.client_access_logs
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));

-- ============== FIX 3: user_sessions_safe view ==============
-- Views can't have RLS directly, but we can ensure security_barrier is set
-- and verify the underlying table has proper RLS

-- Verify user_sessions has FORCE RLS (should already be set)
ALTER TABLE public.user_sessions FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Recreate view with security_barrier to ensure RLS inheritance
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.user_sessions_safe CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW public.user_sessions_safe
WITH (security_barrier = true, security_invoker = true)
AS
SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  created_at,
  last_activity_at,
  expires_at,
  ip_address,
  user_agent,
  CASE
    WHEN expires_at > now() THEN 'active'::text
    ELSE 'expired'::text
  END AS status
FROM public.user_sessions;

-- Explicitly grant only to authenticated, revoke from anon
GRANT SELECT ON public.user_sessions_safe TO authenticated;
REVOKE ALL ON public.user_sessions_safe FROM anon;

COMMENT ON VIEW public.user_sessions_safe IS 
'SECURITY: Uses security_barrier=true and security_invoker=true to inherit RLS from user_sessions table. Only authenticated users can query, and they only see their own sessions (or all if admin) via inherited policies.';
